Freshman year of college, I was terrified of recruiting. It sounded overwhelming: my peers would talk about the 20
internships they applied for, and the thought of coding in front of an adult made me panic.

Imposter Syndrome hit hard, and 18 year old me couldn't tell you one good reason why a company should hire me.

Through lots of trial and error, power posing, and recruiting coffee chats later, I can now say that I am confident in
my recruiting skills. Trust me, if I can grow to be "good" at recruiting, so can anyone.

I am excited to share the recruiting and networking tips and tricks that I've learned over the past three years. These
are the steps I've found to be the most helpful to ensure that by the time you walk into the interview, you know you
have done everything you could have to succeed.

# I'll be going over:‍‍

## Pre-Application Prep

What is needed before you send out your application. How can you accentuate your own strengths and make sure you stand
out? I list some of the internships that are common amongst tech, including those for freshman and sophomores,
specifically for those underrepresented in tech.‍

## Getting Your Foot in the Door

Personally, the most important step I find in the recruiting process. How do you get a connection with someone who works
at the company to make sure your resume is seen or your name has been heard? Once you have someone to advocate for you,
all you need to do is perform.‍‍

## You Got an Interview, Now What?

My advice for technical and PM interviews as well as behavioral questions I am asked at every company without fail.
Practice practice practice, but note that perfection is not the end goal.‍

## Interview Time

What can you do during the interview to make sure all of your hard work pays off? A smile and high energy go a long way.
