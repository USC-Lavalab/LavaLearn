When developing software, knowing just one language or framework is usually not enough. Any complex system has various parts working together to create the final product.

When referring to a system architecture, we usually divide our code into two parts: backend and frontend. The backend is responsible for all of the "business logic," such as servers, databases, and APIs. On the other hand, the frontend is responsible for handling the user's input and displaying everything nicely.

In LavaLab, the fundamentals of full-stack development are especially important as teams are expected to produce a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) by the end of the semester. So understanding how different pieces of code communicate with one another is crucial to successfully get your product in the hands of consumers.
